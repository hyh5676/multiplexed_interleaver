# multiplexed_interleaver
This project offers a multi-mode interleaver that supports a bit width of 8 bits and a data length that is any multiple of 8. You can modify its length by adjusting the length parameter (for example, 904, 920, etc.). Additionally, we provide a test file and an instruction report.
